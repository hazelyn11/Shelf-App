# Shelf App Database Project

This project contains the database structure, as well as some preliminary data, for the Shelf App. Shelf allows users to track their reading habits, plan what to read next, and reflect on books they have already read, as well as find local independent bookstores, libraries, and events in their area. There are a few different user personas who benefit from using Shelf:

1. Reader: This user can track their own reading habits and view friend reading habits, as well as create different “playlists” or “bookshelves”, grouping books with similar themes together.

2. Author: This user is able to see rating information for their work, as well as average rating by year and by month.

3. Bookstore: This user can publicize special events, like trivia nights or readings. If a reading features an Author, Bookstores will be able to indicate the Author in question. 

This GitHub repo includes a .sql file with the database structure and preliminary data, as well as a views.py file with initial routes for the app's front end.
